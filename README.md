# Portfolio-Swati

# Overview
This is my portfolio consisting of all the skills I have learnt and the Projects I have built as part of my Online Coding BootCamp Thinkful.

# Technical
- The app is built mainly with front-end technologies, specifically React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- It utilizes ES6 features of JavaScript, making the code easier to read and maintain. These features are transpiled using Babel to work on all browsers.
- The Airbnb JavaScript style guide is followed to ensure consistent, clean code is produced.
- All front-end components have been tested using Mocha, and the production version passes all tests.
- The front end is fully responsive and follows clean usability principles.
- Continuous integration using Travis CI was used during development.
- Heroku (server hosting) and Netlify for client side deployment.
